# example_fail-log_craftingDH

This GitHub repository is an example fail log for the [Crafting Digital History Workbook](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/). The point of a fail log is to openly discuss your worries, pose questions, and reflect on your weekly learning. Dr. Graham will review your fail log and offer individual or class-wide feedback. Note that while this work can seem daunting, a fail log will help generate open discussion and track your educational growth. The log is meant to help document your work. Remember: **Document what you do, and do what you document.**

 I'm finding github isn't intuitive and learning a new approach slow and scary (need to read, reread and think). 
 Not sure if I can usefully do very much on this course without VPN access to the computer box referenced in the text.
